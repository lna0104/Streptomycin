--------------------------------------------------------------------

Screened mutations:
    Number of distinct mutations screened: 7
    Number of amino acid sites: 4
Predicted intrinsic resistance:
    Total number of resistance mutations present across species: 1422

Evolvability I (number of AA mutations that a species can mutate to):
    Range: 1...7
    95% inter-quantile range: 4...7
    Median: 7
    Theoretical range: 0...7
