--------------------------------------------------------------------

Screened mutations:
    Number of distinct mutations screened: 60
    Number of amino acid sites: 19
Predicted intrinsic resistance:
    Total number of resistance mutations present across species: 1567
    Number of unique mutations present across species: 37
    Number of resistant species: 1453
    Percentage of resistant species: 8.02%
    Number of species with multiple resistance mutations: 104

Evolvability I (number of AA mutations that a species can mutate to):
    Range: 27...49
    95% inter-quantile range: 35...47
    Median: 42
    Theoretical range: 2...53
