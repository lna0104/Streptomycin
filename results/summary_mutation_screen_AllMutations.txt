--------------------------------------------------------------------

Screened mutations:
    Number of distinct mutations screened: 145
    Number of amino acid sites: 29
Predicted intrinsic resistance:
    Total number of resistance mutations present across species: 1738
    Number of unique mutations present across species: 48
    Number of resistant species: 1578
    Percentage of resistant species: 8.71%
    Number of species with multiple resistance mutations: 132
    Number of species where one rpoB copy confers resistance and one does not: 68
Evolvability I (number of AA mutations that a species can mutate to):
    Range: 38...62
    95% inter-quantile range: 43...54
    Median: 49
    Theoretical range: 21...77
Evolvability II (number of mutations that can produce a resistance mutation):
    Range: 43...158
    95% inter-quantile range: 49...60
    Median: 54
    Theoretical range: 21...134
Associations between evolvabilities (phylogenetically uncontrolled):
    Evolvability I vs. evolvability II: r=0.638
    Intrinsic resistance vs. evolvability I: p=0.00165 (Welch Two Sample t-test, t=3.15)
    Intrinsic resistance vs. evolvability II: p=1.45e-39 (Welch Two Sample t-test, t=13.5)
