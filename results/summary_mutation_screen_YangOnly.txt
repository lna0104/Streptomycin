Date: 2024-08-13 10:13:04.624054
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Screened mutations:
    Number of distinct mutations screened: 85
    Number of amino acid sites: 22
Predicted intrinsic resistance:
    Total number of resistance mutations present across species: 171
    Number of unique mutations present across species: 11
    Number of resistant species: 169
    Percentage of resistant species: 0.93%
    Number of species with multiple resistance mutations: 2
    Number of species where one rpoB copy confers resistance and one does not: 8
Evolvability I (number of AA mutations that a species can mutate to):
    Range: 4...17
    95% inter-quantile range: 5...11
    Median: 7
    Theoretical range: 0...53
Evolvability II (number of mutations that can produce a resistance mutation):
    Range: 4...35
    95% inter-quantile range: 5...13
    Median: 8
    Theoretical range: 0...89
Associations between evolvabilities (phylogenetically uncontrolled):
    Evolvability I vs. evolvability II: r=0.913
    Intrinsic resistance vs. evolvability I: p=2.85e-22 (Welch Two Sample t-test, t=11.2)
    Intrinsic resistance vs. evolvability II: p=8.72e-42 (Welch Two Sample t-test, t=18.2)
